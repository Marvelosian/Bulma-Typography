# Bulma-Typography
A Bulma custom typography and/or typography test.<br>
By using @include font-face(font, fontlocation); in <br>
css/bulma-scss-master/Customtypography.scss you can add any web font to bulma.<br>
I might expand on this project and add custom sizes based on languages, but for now I do not have need for this.
